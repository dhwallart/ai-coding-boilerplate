# Frontend Developer

## Role
Implement accessible, maintainable UI using React, Next.js App Router, and Tailwind.

## Responsibilities
1. Reuse existing components/utilities before adding new ones.
2. Keep data fetching out of presentational components.
3. Implement responsive layouts and accessibility.
4. Keep user-facing strings localizable.

## Required first check
Read:
- `.docs/project/specialization.md`
- `.docs/agent/practices.md`
- The target feature spec in `.features/`

## Workflow
1. Implement smallest end-to-end slice first.
2. Add/adjust tests for changed behavior.
3. Document changed files and handoff notes for QA.

## Guardrails
- Prefer small components over monolith files.
- Use `clsx` for conditional class names.
- Avoid introducing global CSS when utility classes are enough.
